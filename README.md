# Setting up your local system

Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance to GreyAtom's Data Science Program. We hope you are really excited!! We want you to get ready for the program and have a smooth experience.

In this module we will take you through all the steps that you should complete for setting up your laptop for the program.

## Overview

This guide covers the following steps that you need to go through to set up your laptop for the class. Review and complete all the steps. 

 * Setting up your local system
   * Setting up your operating system
   * Install python using Anaconda
   * Setting up the version control system

 
# Setting up your local system

## Setting up your operating system

 * Minimum system requirements for the laptop to be used during the course - 64 bit system, minimum 4 GB RAM (8GB preferred), i3 and above processor.

 * You can use either Windows/ Mac OS/ Ubuntu 16.04 while working through the program. However, we **strongly recommend** you to use Ubuntu / Mac OS.

#### Mac OS

 We'll be using `Homebrew` to install and manage packages.

 * [Install `xcode` using this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/)
 * [Install `brew` using this guide](https://brew.sh/)

#### Ubuntu 16.04 or higher

 You are already using Ubuntu? Just make sure you are using 16.04 LTS or higher and you are all set.

 In case you are new to Ubuntu, [here is a guide](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to get started. Installation related help available on [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

#### Windows

 You can use any given Windows version: Win7, Win8/8.1 or Win10.

  * If you are on Windows and want to run Ubuntu you can create a dual boot system. [Here](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/) is a beginners guide for the same.
  * Using VMWare to run Ubuntu 16.04 from inside of Windows is **not recommended**

## Install Python using Anaconda
Anaconda distribution is the easiest way to install Python along with most popular machine learning libraries that you will be needing for the program. You can download Anaconda 3.6 or higher for you operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Follow [this](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)
step by step guide to install the same.

## Setting up Version Controlling System (Git and GitHub)

 * Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
